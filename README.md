## About

FelixHub is a personal web project aimed at providing a platform to share my projects and contributions. It hosts a variety of tools, resources, and information about my journey as a developer. This repository is a part of that project and includes the code and setup used for the website and API.

> **Important**: The AI features on the website require Ollama to be installed. Please ensure that you have Ollama set up to use the AI functionality.

## Features

- Showcase of projects with images and descriptions
- Interactive API to demonstrate functionality
- Clean and responsive design for all devices
- User authentication for secure login and session management
- Show documentation for the project and its APIs

## Technologies

This project is built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Fastify
- **Real-time Interaction**: Redis (for message queues)
- **Code Highlighting**: Highlight.js (for displaying code snippets)
- **AI Interaction**: Ollama (for integrating AI models)
- **Ngrok**: For tunneling HTTP requests from felixhub to ngrok url to the local server
- **Containerization**: Docker (for building and deploying the app)
- **Kubernetes**: K3s (for container orchestration)

## Installation

### Option 1: Install Locally

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Feelfeel20088/felixhub.dev.git
    cd felixhub.dev
    ```

2. Install dependencies using **npm**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up environment variables:

    Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and add your necessary API keys, database credentials, etc. Example:

    ```
    DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
    API_KEY=your_api_key
    REDIS_URL=your_redis_url
    ```

4. Start the server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The website should now be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Option 2: Docker Installation

If you prefer using Docker to run the project, you can pull the pre-built container from Docker Hub and run it:

1. Pull the Docker image:

    ```bash
    docker pull feelfeel200088/felixhub
    ```

2. Run the container:

    ```bash
    docker run -p 8080:8080 feelfeel200088/felixhub
    ```

    This will run the project in a Docker container, and the website will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Option 3: Kubernetes Installation (with `kubectl`)

For those who want to deploy using Kubernetes, you can use the `deployments.yaml` file.

1. navigate to the deployments directory and apply the Kubernetes configuration:

    ```bash
    cd deployments 
    ```
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f ./ 
    ```

    This will deploy the website to your Kubernetes cluster.

2. view the website:

    `http://<ANY_NODE_IP>:30000/`


    if you understand kuberneties you can modify the `deployment.yaml` file to your liking to even exspose the website to the internet
